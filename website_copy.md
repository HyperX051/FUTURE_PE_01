## PROMPT 1: SYSTEM ROLE
ANALYSIS PHASE (Strategy Statement)

Primary Pain Point (IIT Audience):
IIT students, researchers, and professors struggle to find a quiet, reliable, late-night space that supports deep cognitive work without forcing compromises on food quality, payment convenience, or focus. Most cafés either close early, push greasy food that causes crashes, or feel socially distracting rather than intellectually supportive.

USP-to-Pain Solution Mapping:

20/7 Operation (8 AM – 4 AM): Solves the late-night study and deadline problem without uncertainty.

Student Credit Integration: Removes friction around payments during long sessions; no wallet anxiety at 2 AM.

Nutritious Brain Food: Supports sustained concentration instead of post-meal sluggishness.

Royal Arabic Musk Latte: Creates a ritual anchor—something memorable and grounding during intense study cycles.

Core Strategy:
Position Qahwa Commons as an intellectual sanctuary, not a café—an extension of the IIT academic environment where serious thinking is respected, supported, and sustained.
